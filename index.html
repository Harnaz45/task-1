        The founding document of New Zealand is the Treaty of Waitangi. It was first signed on February 6, 1840, in a location in the Bay of Islands, hence its name. New Zealand presently observes this day as a public holiday. The Treaty is an agreement signed in both Māori and English by the British Crown and approximately 540 Māori rangatira.

            In the late 1830s, New Zealand saw an increase in the number of British settlers, with ambitions for a large-scale colony. At this period, there were significant land deals with the Māori, some settlers acting erratically, and indications that the French were considering annexing New Zealand. After a period of inaction, the British administration came to understand that annexing the nation could safeguard Māori interests, control British citizens, and advance commercial goals.

            <p>Securing British control over New Zealand was the duty assigned to Lieutenant-Governor William Hobson. James Busby, the British resident in New Zealand, was one of the people he turned to for guidance and encouragement. In a few of days, the Treaty was ready. Overnight on February 4, missionary Henry Williams and his son Edward translated the English draft into Māori. The agreement was debated by about 500 Māori for a day and a night before to its signing on February 6.</p>
